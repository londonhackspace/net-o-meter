Timeout does us, so 1 us wait?

d0

WR	low -> high to send data or command
a0	data/command
rd	1
ss	0 // clockish
BL	1 // blank

to put in data:

data, ss low, wr low
wait 100ns
wr high
wait 10ns
ss high
busy should be high now.

for normal ops:

reset is high
bl is high
wr is low - we don't do any reading.
rd is high
ss is low

op codes:

0x00 - 0x4f - set write position


set position:

0x1b
row (counting from 0 at the top)
column (0-19)
